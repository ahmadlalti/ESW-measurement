# ESW-measurement
Code to measure dispersion relation of electrostatic waves using spin plane interferometry on MMS.

The code requires IRFU MATLAB to be installed. The package can be found here: https://github.com/irfu/irfu-matlab.

It also requires that the simulation data be available in the same directory as the code.

The simulation data can be downloaded here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7310062.

A detailed description of the method implemented in this code can be found hereL https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2211.06221
